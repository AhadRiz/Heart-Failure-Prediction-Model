Developed a predictive model for heart failure diagnosis using logistic regression on a Kaggle dataset of 918 patients with 11 medical features. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training/testing to achieve an accuracy of over 90%. Key steps included handling missing values, detecting anomalies, visualizing correlations, and implementing classification algorithms. Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Key Contributions:
-->Preprocessed and analyzed medical data to enhance prediction accuracy
-->Trained and tested the model with an 80-20% split, optimizing performance
-->Utilized Python’s scikit-learn library for implementation and evaluation
--> Explored AI applications in healthcare diagnostics

This project highlights the potential of machine learning in medical predictions and reinforces my expertise in data science, classification models, and real-world AI applications.
